# Physics-Calculator
# Overview
This repository contains a Python program for a physics calculator. It is designed to assist users in performing various physics calculations, including calculations related to Newton's laws, forces, and other physics concepts. This program was created as part of my portfolio to showcase my programming skills and my understanding of applied physics.

# Features
Modular Structure: The program is organized into modular functions for different types of physics calculations, which makes it easy to extend and maintain.

User-Friendly Menus: The program offers a user-friendly menu system, allowing users to select the type of calculation they want to perform.

Error Handling: Robust error handling is implemented to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring that the program remains stable even in the presence of incorrect inputs or unexpected issues.

Documentation: Comments and docstrings have been added to explain the purpose and usage of functions and code sections, making the code more understandable for others.

Input Validation: User inputs are validated to ensure they are within acceptable ranges or formats. Numeric inputs are checked for validity, and menu choices are validated to prevent invalid selections.

Testing: The program has been thoroughly tested with various inputs and scenarios to ensure its correctness and robustness. Unit tests for individual functions are provided to verify their behavior.

# Usage
To use the program, simply run the Main_menu() function, which serves as the entry point. From there, you can navigate the menu system to perform different physics calculations.
